Unity-based Surgical Training with Enhanced Posture Monitoring
Overview:

This GitHub project focuses on advancing surgical training using Unity, Inverse Kinematics (IK), and Unity Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS). The project integrates data from Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and HTC Vive Trackers to simulate accurate joint movement in the body. The use of DOTS enables efficient data collection and analysis to generate precise joint angles. A key feature is the development of a tutor system that evaluates a student's joint angles during surgery, comparing them with standardized angles to improve posture and enhance training outcomes.
Key Features:

    Inverse Kinematics Model:
        Implementation and modification of an Inverse Kinematics model to simulate realistic joint movement based on positional and orientation data from HMD and HTC Vive Trackers.
        Accurate representation of the surgeon's body movements, enhancing the immersive experience in surgical training simulations.

    Unity DOTS Integration:
        Utilization of Unity DOTS for efficient data collection and analysis of positional information.
        Comparison of DOTS-based joint angle calculations with traditional motion tracking software solutions to evaluate performance and accuracy.

    Posture Monitoring and Correction:
        Development of a tutor system that assesses the joint angles of a student performing surgery.
        Comparison of student's joint angles with standardized angles to provide real-time feedback and guidance for maintaining optimal posture during training sessions.

Value in Healthcare:
