Advanced Kinematic Simulation for Surgical Training
Project Description

This groundbreaking project aims to revolutionize surgical training by integrating advanced inverse kinematics models with cutting-edge motion tracking technologies. Utilizing positional and orientation data from Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and HTC Vive Trackers, the system simulates highly accurate joint movements of the human body. This approach offers a significant leap in healthcare training, particularly in surgical procedures.
Key Features

    Inverse Kinematics for Realistic Joint Movement: By creating a sophisticated inverse kinematics model, the project achieves realistic simulations of body joint movements. This is crucial in mimicking the precise and controlled movements required in surgery.

    Integration with HMD and HTC Vive Trackers: The use of HMDs and HTC Vive Trackers for capturing positional and orientation data ensures high accuracy in tracking the movements of different body parts. This data is pivotal in creating a true-to-life kinematic model.

    Unity DOTS for Enhanced Data Processing: Leveraging Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), the project efficiently collects and processes positional data. This generates accurate joint angles and allows for a comparative analysis with traditional motion-tracking software, highlighting the improvements and efficiencies of our system.

    Tutor System for Posture Training: A standout feature is the tutor system, which compares the joint angles of a student performing a surgical procedure with standardized angles. This comparison is instrumental in aiding students to maintain optimal posture during training, reducing the risk of ergonomic injuries and enhancing the precision of their movements.

Value in Healthcare

    Enhanced Surgical Training: The project provides a safe, accurate, and highly immersive environment for surgical trainees, improving their skills without the risks associated with traditional training methods.
    Posture Optimization: By focusing on correct posture, the system not only improves the surgical skills of trainees but also addresses long-term health issues that can arise from poor ergonomic practices.
    Cost-Effective and Scalable: This virtual training system reduces the need for expensive physical models and allows for scalable training programs, making it a cost-effective solution for medical institutions.
    Data-Driven Insights: The ability to collect and analyze precise movement data offers valuable insights into surgical techniques, potentially leading to advancements in surgical methodologies.

Conclusion

This project stands at the forefront of technological innovation in healthcare education. By merging advanced kinematic modeling with state-of-the-art motion tracking and data analysis, it promises to enhance the quality and effectiveness of surgical training significantly. This not only benefits the training surgeons but also has the potential to indirectly improve patient care and surgical outcomes.
